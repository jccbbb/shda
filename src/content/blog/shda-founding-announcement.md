Today marks a historic moment for the Scandinavian hard dance scene. We are proud to announce the official founding of the **Scandinavian Hard Dance Alliance (SHDA)** - a collaborative network of organizers and companies dedicated to promoting hard dance music across the Nordic countries.

## The Vision

For years, hard dance organizers across Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland have worked independently, each facing similar challenges and opportunities. While healthy competition drives excellence, we recognized that collaboration could take our scene to unprecedented heights.

SHDA was born from a simple but powerful idea: **we are stronger together**.

## Founding Members

The alliance launches with eight passionate founding members:

1. **Forced 2 Dance** (Sweden) - Main founder
2. **Effekt Events** (Sweden)
3. **DAP Events** (Sweden)
4. **Hardstyle DNA** (Finland)
5. **The Resistance** (Finland)
6. **Hardevents** (Denmark)
7. **Coretours** (Multi-country)
8. **Hardstyle Sweden** (Sweden)

Each of these organizations brings unique expertise, experience, and passion to the alliance.

## Our Mission

SHDA exists to:

- **Promote Collaboration:** Share resources, knowledge, and opportunities
- **Elevate Quality:** Maintain high standards across all member events
- **Support Growth:** Help each other succeed and expand
- **Build Community:** Strengthen connections within the Scandinavian hard dance scene
- **Celebrate Passion:** Keep love for the music at the center of everything we do

## What We'll Do

The alliance operates through several key activities:

### Quarterly Meetings
Four times per year, members gather to network, share insights, and plan collaborations. These meetings rotate between countries to ensure accessibility.

### Resource Sharing
From equipment and infrastructure to marketing materials and industry contacts, we pool resources to reduce costs and improve quality.

### Collaborative Events
Members work together on bookings, joint events, and cross-promotional campaigns that benefit everyone.

### Knowledge Exchange
We share expertise on everything from pricing strategies to social media marketing, helping each other grow and improve.

## A New Chapter

This is just the beginning. As SHDA grows and evolves, we're committed to maintaining the values that brought us together: passion for hard dance music, commitment to quality, and dedication to our community.

We're excited about the future of hard dance in Scandinavia, and we invite you to join us on this journey. Whether you're an organizer interested in membership or a fan excited about what's coming, the best is yet to come.
